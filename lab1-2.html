	<h1>Pets and the Pandemic</h1>
	<h2>Article by Xin Ni</h2>

	<p>

		A report from Animal Medicines Australia (AMA) has found that many Australians took the opportunity to introduce a pet into their household during the pandemic.
		Their survey indicated that there was a significant increase in the percent of households taking in a new dog, fish or bird.
		Their research also indicated that pets had a number of positive influences on their lives such as:

		<u1>
			<li>companionship</li>
			<li>better mental health</li>
			<li>joy and happiness.</li>
		</u1>
